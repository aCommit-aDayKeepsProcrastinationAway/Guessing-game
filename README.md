  A number guessing game in C++. Currently very simple. 
##Planning to add following features:

~~1.Add a play again dialogue~~ Status: Finished.

3.Add a scoretable which shows how much guesses it took and history of your guesses Status: On hold

4.Also add a number showing difference between your guess and the actual number in scoretable colored respectively (green, red) Status: On hold

Need to make a scoretable with a proper structure, not sure how at the moment.
